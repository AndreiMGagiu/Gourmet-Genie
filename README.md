## User Stories:
1. As a user, I want to search for recipes based on the ingredients I have, even if the match isn't exact, so that I can find useful meal suggestions without needing all the exact ingredients.

2. As a user, I want to filter recipes by quick meals that can be made in 15 minutes or less, so that I can prepare something fast when I'm short on time.

3. As a user, I want to filter recipes by vegan options so that I can easily find meals that align with my dietary preferences.

4. As a user, I want to filter recipes by vegetarian options so that I can discover recipes that fit my vegetarian diet.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Ruby 3.3.0
- Rails 7.0.8 or higher
- PostgreSQL
- pg_trgm extension for PostgreSQL

## Installation

```bash 
 git clone git@github.com:AndreiMGagiu/Gourmet-Genie.git
 cd gourmet-genie
```

2. Install dependencies: `bundle install`

3. Set up environment variables:
Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the necessary environment variables:

## Database Setup
1. Create the database: `rails db:create`
2. Run migrations: `rails db:migrate`
3. Enable the `pg_trgm` extension:
```bash  
psql -d your_database_name -c 'CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;'
```

## Importing Data
To import recipe data, run the following rake task: `rails import:recipes`
This will import recipes from the `db/data/recipes.json` file.

## Running the Application
Start the Rails server: 
    `rails server`. The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Endpoints
```base
 GET /api/v1/recipes/search?ingredients=ingredient1,ingredient2: Search for recipes by ingredients
 GET /api/v1/recipes/:id/ingredients: Get ingredients, category, and ratings for a specific recipe
```

## Running Tests
To run the test suite: `rspec`

## Recipe Search Overview
In V1 of Gourmet Genie, the search algorithm is designed to find recipes based on ingredients without needing an exact match. It looks for recipes that contain some or all of the ingredients you enter by using similarity matching. This means even if the ingredient names donâ€™t perfectly match, the app can still suggest relevant recipes.

For this first version, I kept it simple and flexible so users can quickly get helpful results.

## Database Structure
1. **User**: Represents users who create recipes. Each user has a unique name and can have multiple `recipes` and `ratings`.
2. **Recipe**: The core model representing recipes. Each recipe belongs to a `user` and a `category`, and `has_many ingredients` through `recipe_ingredients`. It also `has_many dietary requirements` through `recipe_dietary_requirements` and can have multiple `ratings`.
3. **Category**: Used to group recipes under specific labels (e.g., "Vegan", "Dessert").
4. **Ingredient**: Represents individual ingredients used in recipes.
5. **RecipeIngredient**: A join table connecting `recipes` and `ingredients`, including quantity and unit information.
6. **DietaryRequirement**: Represents dietary restrictions or preferences (e.g., "Vegetarian", "Gluten-Free").
7. **RecipeDietaryRequirement**: A join table connecting `recipes` and `dietary requirements`.
8. **Rating**: Represents user ratings for recipes, with a score between 1 and 5.
9. **App**: Represents applications that can access the API, including a secret token and approval status.
